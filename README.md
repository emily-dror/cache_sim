# Cache Memory Simulation

This project implements a cache memory simulator similar to the one presented at
Computer Architecture (236267) class. The simulator will be limited and initialized at
the start of the run with the specified parameters. Additionally, the simulator will
read a trace file in which access instructions to the memory are detailed. The
simulator will produce the hit/miss rate and the average access time for the memory for
the given trace (the trace file).
